# Canary
## WE NO LONGER SUPPORT PYTHON 2! Due to Python 2's deprecation, we have deprecated Python 2.7 APIs.
An open source self-flying car framework for everyone!

Canary is an end-to-end, flexible ecosystem of tools to help developers in making autonomous flying cars.

**NOTE:** We currently only provide stable APIs for C++ and Python 3. Stay tuned for updates in more APIs!
